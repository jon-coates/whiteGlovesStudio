## Notes for Implementation

### Testing Strategy
- Each task should be completed and tested independently
- Use localhost:3000 for frontend and localhost:3001 for CMS during development
- Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
- Verify TypeScript compilation passes for each task

### Development Environment
- Use Node.js 18+ for both frontend and CMS
- MongoDB can be local or MongoDB Atlas free tier during development
- Use placeholder content initially, replace with real content in final tasks

### Task Dependencies
- Tasks 1-4 must be completed before others
- CMS tasks (5-12) should be completed before frontend integration (14+)
- Core components (13-17) needed before page implementation
- Deployment tasks (44-45) require all previous tasks complete

### Success Criteria
Each task is considered complete when:
1. The specific functionality works as described
2. No TypeScript compilation errors
3. The feature can be demonstrated/tested as specified
4. Code follows consistent patterns established in earlier tasks
